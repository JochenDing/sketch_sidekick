Welcome to the world of electronic creation! Sidekick Advanced Kit is an Arduino electronics kit that can lead you to world of electronic. It contains the most common electronic components such as resistors, Leds etc. Also contains a large number of rich expansion functional modules, such as temperature and humity sensors, 16x2 LCD display, servo, stepper and so on. This tutorial content of the discussion from the official Arduino tutorials with Seeed resource. This kit contains 39 examples, which can help to start your Arduino development quickly.



<br>
## Usage:

This is a Sketchbook of Arduino.([How to use Sketchbook](http://www.seeedstudio.com/wiki/How_To_Use_Sketchbook "How to use Sketchbook"))

This Sketchbook includes 7 demos about sensor of the kit. 


<br>
### Light Sensor
This demo will show you how to use light sensor. In order to indicate the intensity of light, we need a Led Bar.

* Light Sensor connect to A0 of Arduino
* LED Bar connect to D2~D11


<br>
### Temperature Sensor

You can use Temp & Humi Sensor to get temperature and humidity of your house.
This demo will show you how to get the value and show it to LCD.

* Temp & Humi Sensor connect to A0


<br>
### Sound Sensor And LED Bar

This demo will show you how to use Sound Sensor, to indicate the intensity of sound, we need a LED Bar.

* Sound Sensor connect to A0 of Arduino
* LED Bar connect to D2~D11


<br>
### IR Remote

IR is a very common means of communication. This demo will show you how to use IR send and receive module.
Large of household appliances is controled by IR Remote, such as TV, air conditioning and so on.
We can use IR module to control those appliances also.

* IR Emitter connect to D3
* IR Receiver connect to A4


<br>
### Relay Control LED

This demo will show you how to use Relay. Actually, Relay is an electronic switch that can be controled by an IO.
Relay is mainly used for weak power control strong power. For example, use your Arduino to control a lamp, you need a Realy. Here we'll use relay to control a LED.

* Relay connect to D2


<br>
### Joystick Control RGB Led

You can use Joystick in some control occasion, such as control a toy car.
This demo will show you how to use joystick, and we need a Rgb Led else, when joystick in different location, Rgb Led will show different color.

* Joystick connect to A0, A1
* RGB LED connect to D3, D9 and D10


<br>
### RFID Control LED

125KHz RFID Reader can read data from RFID tag. It's can use for some IoT or Intelligent Control System.
This demo will show you how to Read data from RFID tag, and control a LED.

* RFID reader connect to D2 and D3
